# Help Desk Portal Frontend - Project Specification

## Project Overview

Create a modern, responsive help desk portal frontend using Angular 20 with two separate applications in an Nx monorepo, designed to work seamlessly with the HIPAA-compliant backend API. The system consists of:

1. **help-desk-portal**: Customer-facing application for end users to create tickets, track status, and communicate with support
